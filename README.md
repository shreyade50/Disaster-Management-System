# Disaster-Management-System
This application helps bring citizens together in their time of need. 
* Our website serves as a platform facilitating the collaboration of individuals from diverse locations to provide aid and assistance to those affected by disasters.
* In this project we have two kinds of users: the **Admin who controls and updates details on the site and the **Volunteers who register themselves to help people in the affected area.
* The tasks that volunteers can undertake encompass a spectrum, including relief efforts, distribution of food and medical supplies,as well as participation in cleaning and support activities.

Later, Our team would like to take it to the next level.By integrating advanced technology and improving it along with time.
